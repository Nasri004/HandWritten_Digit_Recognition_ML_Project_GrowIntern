# HandWritten_Digit_Recognition_ML_Project_GrowIntern
This project builds a system to detect and recognize handwritten digits using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The system processes images of digits and classifies them into numerical values (0-9). Leveraging the MNIST dataset, the project demonstrates the application of deep learning in computer vision.
